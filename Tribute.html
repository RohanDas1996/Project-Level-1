                <span class="spn">It</span> was a usual day for me that day.  I was just completing my work and i checked my whatsapp and i saw a status 
                it had a photo with caption R.I.P. I was in disbelief first of all that this can't be true i was not beileving.
                Then i checked google and unfortunately that terrible news comes out to be true. My favourite singer KK is no more
                he dies of a heart attack during a musical concert in kolkata but look even in his last times he was singing  for 
                which he was known for and the very last song he sang was "Hum Rahein Ya Na Rahein Kal" I mean who knows that time 
                that he was singing his last song and he will never sing after that but KK sir thankyou for whatever music you have 
                given to us your music will never die & You and your music will always live in our heart . R.I.P sir.
